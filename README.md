The aim of this case study is to use exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression to predict alcohol levels in wine with a model that's as accurate as possible.

We'll try a univariate analysis (one involving a single explanatory variable) as well as a multivariate one (involving multiple explanatory variables), and we'll iterate together towards a decent model by the end of the notebook.

For this notebook, we're going to use the red wine dataset, wineQualityReds.csv. Make sure it's downloaded and sitting in your working directory. This is a very common dataset for practicing regression analysis and is actually freely available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piyushgoyal443/red-wine-dataset)
